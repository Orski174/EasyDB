# EasyDB Tables

In this folder, we will be creating a file for each table. Each file will include:

- Definition of each table
- Specification of the type of each attribute or column

After defining all table attributes, we will then define the constraints for each table in their corresponding file, giving them meaningful names to be utilized later on.
